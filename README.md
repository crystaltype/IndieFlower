# Indie Flower
by Kimberly Geswein

This handwriting font feels carefree and open to me with the bubbly, rounded edges. It is easy to read and a bit bolder than some of my other fonts.

# Completed tasks:
- Converted project files to .glyphs
- Fixed tasks listed in [ProjectChecklist.md](https://github.com/googlefonts/gf-docs/blob/master/ProjectChecklist.md) and internal planning spreadsheet.
- Corrected OpenType features
- Changed upm from 1024 to 1000

# Todo:
- Improve README.md
- Fix glyphs, anchors and components
- Run fonts through Font bakery and Ship fonts
